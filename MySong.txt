I've waited the longest time
To commit the perfect crime
And all I know
Is some day you will kill and never understand
What lies beneath in the heart of man
As time slips into the ocean
It won’t come back with an act of devotion

Orpheus, played a song
One we haven’t heard in, oh, so long
Shut the gates of hell and lock the door
Throw away the key and say no more
Mesmerise, set the skies
Kill me with your song
All is love and the love is lost
As time slips into the ocean
I believe in love as the ultimate emotion
