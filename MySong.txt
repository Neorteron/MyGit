I've waited the longest time
To commit the perfect crime
And all I know
Is some day you will kill and never understand
What lies beneath in the heart of man
As time slips into the ocean
It won’t come back with an act of devotion

I've paid the ultimate price
Living in paradise
And all I feel
Is so surreal
Kill me with your song
All is love and the love is lost
As time slips into the ocean
It won’t come back with an act of devotion
